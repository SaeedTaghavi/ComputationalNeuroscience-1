    "where $R$ is the neuron membrane resistance, and $\\tau_m = R C$ is the membrane time constant (see 8.2 in Sterratt). The resting potential is here chose to define the zero of the electrical potential. Spikes are emitted whenever the voltage reaches a threshold $\\theta$, i.e., if $V(t^*) = \\theta$. After each spike emission (spike time denoted $t^*$), the potential $V$ is reset to zero.\n",

Find an analytical formula for,  and sketch (by hand), the firing rate $f$ of the neuron as a function of the input current $I$ (what is typically known as the '$f-I$ curve'). Hint: The firing rate $f$ is by the number of spikes per time unit, and in the present noise-free case with a fixed current input, it is given by the inverse  of the inter-spike interval $T$, that is, $1/T$\n",

    "__(ii)__  Guess how the shape of the $f-I$ curve would qualitatively change in the presence of (a small amount of) additive noise, i.e., when $I(t) = I$  in equation 1 is replaced by $I(t) = I + \\mbox{\\emph{noise}}(t)$.\n",
