    "The dominant way of transporting signals between neurons (nerve cells) in the brain is by means of diffusion of particular signal molecules called _neurotransmitters_ across the synaptic cleft separating the cell membranes of the two cells. A drawing of a synapse is Fig. 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the arrival of an action potential in the axon terminal a process is initiated in which (i) vesicles inside the axon terminal (filled with neurotransmitter molecules) merge with the presynaptic (axon) membrane and (ii) release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft to receptors on the postsynaptic side which 'receives' the signal. A schematic illustration of this process is shown in Fig. 2\n",
